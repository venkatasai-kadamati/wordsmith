### Learning 📚
While delving into the depths of project implementation, here are some notable learnings:

1. 🌐 CORS Issue: We encountered the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) problem. To overcome it, we employed a proxy server. It's worth noting that this issue frequently arises when utilizing free APIs.

2. 🎨 Animated Libraries: There is an abundance of animated libraries available, but we discovered that sticking with Lottie libraries proved to be beneficial. They offer minimal design and excellent accessibility features.
